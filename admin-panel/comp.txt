React Native
Overview
Built on top of the Stream Chat API, the Stream Chat React Native SDK components include everything you need to build feature-rich and high-functioning chat user experiences out of the box.

We have component libraries available for both RN CLI and Expo. Each approach includes an extensive set of fast performing and customizable UI components and support which allow you to get started quickly with little to no plumbing required. The libraries support:

Rich media messages
Reactions
Threads and quoted replies
Text input commands (ex: Giphy, emojis and @mentions)
Image and file uploads
Video playback
Read state and typing indicators.
Channel and message lists
Push (APN or Firebase)
Offline storage
and a lot more.
Additionally, starting with version 6.0.0 our SDK supports the React Native new architecture as well. You can read more about it here.

Before getting started with our docs, we recommend going through our tutorials for our React Native SDK.

Where to get started?
If you are new to our SDK, it is best to go through our React Native SDK tutorial.

Architecture
Stream Chat React Native SDK primarily uses the Stream Chat client to connect to and communicate with the Stream API.

The full JavaScript client docs should be referenced for detailed information on directly using the client.

Do not install the stream-chat dependency externally. This may lead to problems while using our SDK. Our SDK has it as a development dependency, so you need not install it externally.

The Stream Chat React Native SDK is segregated into two separate packages:

stream-chat-react-native for React Native CLI applications.
stream-chat-expo for Expo CLI applications.
We recommend using the corresponding package for the respective CLI that the application uses.

Our SDK components are highly customizable for both the interfaces. Unless your UI is completely different from the common industry standard, you should be able to customize the built-in components to match your needs.

The UI SDKs provide both ready-made components that you can directly integrate (and customize) in your apps, or you can build your own, by reacting to the state we expose and re-using our components as building blocks, if needed.

Upgrading and Versioning Strategy
The Stream Chat React Native SDK adheres to the semantic versioning rules.

Bug fixes and behavior improvements cause patch version bump.
New features are shipped with an increased minor version.
Incompatible changes in the API will cause a major version increase.
Occasionally, the SDK can include visual changes (whitespace, color changes, sizing, etc) in minor versions, as we are continuously improving the default look of our UI components. Bumping the major version for such changes would not be practical.

Platform Compatibilities
We only support Android and iOS as platforms for the React Native SDK. We do not support Web currently, but this is in our backlog, and we plan to take this up in the future. As an alternative, you can use Stream’s React SDK for Web.

Sample Apps
We have created some of the sample apps to help understand the usage of the Stream Chat React Native SDK. They can be found in the examples directory of the main repository. Apart from the samples we use for internal development, we also provide some small clone projects like a Slack clone and an iMessage clone. You can check out the code in our repository and even run the apps yourself.

Installation
Installation and usage of our Stream Chat React Native SDK is simple and involves the following steps:

Prerequisites
First things first, make sure you have set up the development environment for React Native. You can find the official guide here.

For Expo, you can follow this guide.

Add Stream’s Chat SDK and its peer dependencies
In order to install the Stream Chat React Native SDK, run the following command in your terminal of choice:

Please follow along the linked documentation of each optional dependencies so as to support them correctly in your application.

Additional Steps
Some dependencies require us to make changes to our application for all functionalities to be available.

The most important steps to get started are:

Add the Babel plugin for react-native-reanimated to your babel.config.js file in your application folder:

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ... // don't add it here :)
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
react-native-reanimated/plugin has to be listed last.

If you are using react-native-reanimated version >=4.0.0, you can replace the react-native-reanimated/plugin with react-native-worklets/plugin in your application’s babel.config.js.


module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ... // don't add it here :)
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...
    'react-native-worklets/plugin',
  ],
};
Read more here.

After installation, wrap your entry point with <GestureHandlerRootView> or gestureHandlerRootHOC:

import { GestureHandlerRootView } from "react-native-gesture-handler";
export default function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* content */}
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
The entry point of your app exists usually either in index.js or App.tsx file. In case of navigation with Expo Router v3.x, the entry point is inside app/_layout.js.

Please also follow the steps mentioned in the links below for corresponding dependencies:

react-native - additional installation steps
Now you should be able to run the app on simulator by running following command:

Overview
Overview
Adding feature rich chat to a React Native application can be quite challenging when starting from scratch. There are many considerations, states, and edge cases that need accounting for, styling, message grouping, read states, context menus, etc. all add to the complexity of the challenge. Stream Chat for React Native provides an easy to implement flexible solution.

Stream Chat for React Native provides a way to add chat to an existing or new application with very little code. The library was built with flexibility and customization in mind, starting with the out of the box form and function one would expect from a chat app you can modify the UI and UX as desired.

Before starting make sure you have installed stream-chat-react-native as directed in the getting started guide.

Creating a Chat Client
Stream Chat for React Native uses stream-chat, Stream’s JavaScript client, to interact with Stream’s chat services. stream-chat is a dependency of Stream Chat for React Native so it is can be used once stream-chat-react-native is installed.

You don’t have to explicitly install stream-chat in your project.

To start, you can sign up for a Free subscription and then get your API key.


import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
Connecting a User
Tokens are used to authenticate a user. Typically, you send this token from your backend to the client when a user registers or logs in. See the Tokens & Authentication documentation to learn more about creating tokens. You can use a developer token if desired, but for the purpose of this guide it will be assumed you have created and retrieved a user_token.

To connect a user the connectUser function should be called and provided with the user object and user_token. Connecting a user could be done in the login flow or elsewhere in the application after the client is instantiated.


await client.connectUser(
  {
    id: "jlahey",
    name: "Jim Lahey",
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/fR9Jz14.png",
  },
  "user_token",
);
It is recommended to not repeatedly call connectUser unnecessarily, multiple calls to connectUser will result in warnings, and attempting to call connectUser before disconnecting a current user will throw an Error.

To disconnect a user you can call disconnectUser on the client.


await client.disconnectUser();
Alternatively, you can also use the useCreateChatClient hook from stream-chat-react-native/stream-chat-expo to create a client instance and automatically connect/disconnect a user.

Creating a Channel
Channels are at the core of Stream Chat, they are where messages are contained, sent, and interacted with. Before delving into the UI components a channel is needed that can be displayed. Let’s start by initializing one.

A channel type is required for creating a channel and controls the settings for a given channel. There are 5 default types of channels.

commerce
gaming
livestream
messaging
team
These five options provide you with sensible defaults for the named use cases. You can also define custom channel types if Stream Chat defaults don’t work for your use case.

A channel must be initialized with either an id or a list of members for the channel. If you provide a list of members an id will be auto-generated on backend for the channel.

You can’t add or remove members from channel created using a list of members.

You can also add additional custom data to a channel. You can add as many custom fields as you desire as long as the total size of the custom fields object is less than 5KB.

For the purpose of this guide you should create a channel as you see fit utilizing either a members list that includes your user’s id, or a channel id. This can be done once, then the code removed as this guide will not be covering on the fly channel creation.


Channel Id

Members List

/**
 *  Channel created using a channel id
 */
const channel = client.channel("messaging", "the_park", {
  name: "The Park",
});
To create this channel on the server you must call create on the new channel instance.


await channel.create();
For on the fly channel creation you would instead call the watch function on the channel as this both creates the channel and subscribes the client to channel updates.

Configuring UI Components
Now that you have a client instance, a user set, and a channel created on the server you can setup your project to use the UI components.

All major stream-chat-react-native components rely on contexts to function properly. The UI and functionality are heavily controlled by a number of components that contain Providers to give access to these contexts.

Overlay Provider
The OverlayProvider is the highest level of the Stream Chat components. The OverlayProvider allows users to interact with messages on long press above the underlying views, use the full screen image viewer, and use the AttachmentPicker as a keyboard-esk view.

The OverlayProvider can be used with no props provided but there are a plethora of props for customizing the components in the overlay.

For additional information on the OverlayProvider check the OverlayProvider docs for detailed usage instructions, including how to properly use the OverlyProvider with React Navigation.


import { OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
export const Screen = () => (
  <OverlayProvider>{/** App components */}</OverlayProvider>
);
Chat
Chat is the next level down of context component from OverlyProvider that is required for stream-chat-react-native to function as designed. You can choose to wrap your entire application in Chat similar to what is required for the OverlayProvider or you can implement Chat at the screen level. Chat has one required prop, client, which is the instance of StreamChat you created.

For additional information on the Chat component check the Chat component docs for detailed usage instructions, including how to provide theming and translations to the app.


App

Screen

import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider>
    <Chat client={client}>{/** App components */}</Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
Channel List
Stream Chat for React Native provides a ChannelList component out of the box for displaying a list of channels. ChannelList can be used with no props and will return all of the channels the set user has access to. To functionally use the ChannelList an onSelect prop should be provided. The onSelect function is called with the selected Channel instance and can then be used to react to the user interaction, for example to store the Channel in state and navigate to the appropriate channel screen.

For additional information on the ChannelList component check the ChannelList component docs, these include instructions on how to filter and sort the ChannelList.

The ChannelList should be implemented inside of the UI components previously configured to provide the appropriate contexts. For the purpose of this guide the example implementation will continue to be given in a single component with the assumption that the client has already been instantiated, a user connected, and a channel the user has access to exists.

ChannelList

import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider>
    <Chat client={client}>
      <ChannelList />
    </Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
These three components in conjunction will provide a FlatList of all channels available to the connected user.

Channel
When creating a chat screen it is required that the Channel component wrap the stream-chat-react-native components being used. Channel provides multiple contexts to the enclosed components and allows for modification and replacement of many of the components. Channel is the major entry point for modifying the look and feel of your chat application.

For additional information on the Channel component, how to modify various features, adjusting for keyboard offsets, and more, check the Channel component docs.

The Channel component does not require any props, but will not function as desired without the channel prop being provided. The channel prop expects a StreamChat Channel instance. This can be created as you did previously, pulled directly from the client.activeChannels, or conveniently stored when a channel is selected from the ChannelList.


import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Channel as ChannelType, StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => {
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState<ChannelType>();
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={client}>
        {channel ? (
          <Channel channel={channel}>{/** App components */}</Channel>
        ) : (
          <ChannelList onSelect={setChannel} />
        )}
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
Message List
The Channel component on it’s own will not provide any UI. For this additional components are required, most notably the MessageList component. MessageList has no required props, and when used in concert with the Channel component should function properly out of the box.

For additional information on the MessageList component, how to pass props to the underlying FlatList, or use the MessageList for threads, check the MessageList component docs.

MessageList

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Channel as ChannelType, StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => {
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState<ChannelType>();
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={client}>
        {channel ? (
          <Channel channel={channel}>
            <MessageList />
          </Channel>
        ) : (
          <ChannelList onSelect={setChannel} />
        )}
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
Message Input
A chat app needs to be able to send messages, and for this Stream Chat for React Native provides a MessageInput component. Similar to the MessageList component MessageInput has no required props. Adding it to the app is as simple as rendering it below the MessageList.

Be sure to set the keyboardVerticalOffset on Channel to the appropriate height based off any header spacing. As there is currently no header the keyboardVerticalOffset can be set to 0.

For additional information on the MessageInput component, how to modify it using context, or designate it for thread use via the threadList prop, check the MessageInput component docs.

MessageInput

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Channel as ChannelType, StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => {
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState<ChannelType>();
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={client}>
        {channel ? (
          <Channel channel={channel} keyboardVerticalOffset={0}>
            <MessageList />
            <MessageInput />
          </Channel>
        ) : (
          <ChannelList onSelect={setChannel} />
        )}
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
This small code snippet is enough to render a list of channels and swap them out for a functional and feature rich message list and input when one is selected.

Thread
There is one more high level component that Stream Chat for React Native provides out of the box, and that is Thread. Stream Chat supports threaded messages, and the MessageList supplies a UI for threads out of the box. But as a thread on a mobile messaging app generally exists in a separate screen it is up to you to handle thread selection and subsequent navigation in your implementation. Thread has no required props as it relies heavily on context to function. The simple code snippet can be extended to include Thread and keep track of a thread state similarly to channel by utilizing the onThreadSelect prop on the MessageList. The code snippet now has a fully functional ChannelList, MessageList, and threadList, although currently it provides no way to back out of the sudo-navigation.

For additional information on the Thread component, such as how to use onThreadDismount to manage your thread state, check the Thread component docs.

Thread

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Channel as ChannelType, LocalMessage, StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => {
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState<ChannelType>();
  const [thread, setThread] = useState<LocalMessage | null>();
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={client}>
        {channel ? (
          <Channel
            channel={channel}
            keyboardVerticalOffset={0}
            thread={thread}
            threadList={!!thread}
          >
            {thread ? (
              <Thread />
            ) : (
              <>
                <MessageList onThreadSelect={setThread} />
                <MessageInput />
              </>
            )}
          </Channel>
        ) : (
          <ChannelList onSelect={setChannel} />
        )}
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
Summary
You need a client that is an instance of StreamChat to provide to the UI components so they function correctly.

You need to connect a user via the connectUser call to interact with the backend properly. To do this you need to create tokens as per the Tokens & Authentication docs.

You need to surround your app with the OverlayProvider for the UI to function properly, and your app or chat screen with the Chat component to provide data to the UI components.

ChannelList provides access to the list of available channels in the UI, and using props, can be queried, filtered, and sorted as desired. ChannelList also provides convenient functionality for implementing navigation to a selected Channel.

The Channel component is the functional wrapper of the MessageList, MessageInput, and Thread components. It is the access point for the majority of the customization of the SDK, and controls much of the functionality.

Theme
Theme
The majority of components used in stream-chat-react-native can have custom styles applied to them via the theming system.

Setting the theme
To accurately create a theme, we suggest utilizing our exported types to create your own theme. This will allow you to ensure the keys you are using in your theme object are correct.

When you provide a theme as a prop a deep merge of the theme and default theme is performed so only styles designated in the custom theme overwrite the defaults. We provide a helper type DeepPartial that makes all of the keys at every depth optional, this is to account for the deep merge that is performed.

You can find the default theme object in theme.ts.

Most of the styles are standard React Native styles, but some styles applying to SVG, Markdown, or custom components are numbers, strings, or other specified types. The TypeScript documentation of Theme should help you in this regard. Message text is an instance of an exception as it is rendered using react-native-markdown-package and the MarkdownStyle is added to the theme at key messageSimple -> content -> markdown.


import type { DeepPartial, Theme } from 'stream-chat-react-native';
const theme: DeepPartial<Theme> = {
  messageSimple: {
    file: {
      container: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
    },
  },
};
Now you can provide this theme object to the style key of the value prop of the OverlayProvider component.


import { Chat, ChannelList, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const style = { style: theme };
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider value={style}>
    <Chat client={client}>
      <ChannelList />
    </Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
Using the theme
You can easily access the theme in any custom components you create using the useTheme hook. To ensure any change to the theme is reflected within the UI it is not advised to pass theme variables through custom memoization checks.


const {
  theme: {
    colors: { black },
  },
} = useTheme();
Dark mode
If you would like to support dark mode in your application, you can create and apply different themes depending on the current colorScheme provided by React Native. To prevent unnecessary deep merges and re-renders we suggest keeping the current theme in state and only change it when theme colorScheme changes.


import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
import type { DeepPartial, Theme } from 'stream-chat-react-native';
const getTheme = (): DeepPartial<Theme> => ({
  colors: colorScheme === 'dark' ? { black: '#FFFFFF' } : { black: '#000000' },
});
export const App = () => {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(getTheme());
  useEffect(() => {
    setTheme(getTheme());
  }, [colorScheme]);
  return (
    <OverlayProvider value={{ style: theme }}>
      <Chat client={client}>
        <ChannelList />
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};

OverlayProvider
OverlayProvider
The OverlayProvider is the top-level Stream Chat for React Native component and wraps all other components provided by the SDK. The OverlayProvider allows users to interact with messages on long press above the underlying views, use the full screen image viewer.

General Usage
The OverlayProvider should wrap all other Stream Chat for React Native components and in most cases the majority of your application.

Note: For detailed implementation instructions of the OverlayProvider with navigation please refer to the Navigation guide.


import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import { ChannelList, Chat, OverlayProvider } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider>
    <Chat client={client}>
      <ChannelList />
    </Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
Context Providers
OverlayProvider contains providers for the AttachmentPickerContext, ImageGalleryContext, OverlayContext, ThemeContext, and TranslationContext. These can be accessed using the corresponding hooks.

Context	Hook
| ImageGalleryContext | useImageGalleryContext | | OverlayContext | useOverlayContext | | ThemeContext | useTheme | | TranslationContext | useTranslationContext |

Props

OverlayContext
OverlayContext
OverlayContext is provided by OverlayProvider component. If you are not familiar with React Context API, please read about it on React docs.

Basic Usage
OverlayContext can be consumed by any of the child component of OverlayProvider component as following:


import { useContext } from "react";
import { OverlayContext } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const { setOverlay } = useContext(OverlayContext);
Alternatively, you can also use useOverlayContext hook provided by library to consume OverlayContext.


import { useOverlayContext } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const { setOverlay } = useOverlayContext();
Value
overlay
Current active overlay. Overlay gets rendered in following cases

‘alert’ - For delete message confirmation alert box
‘gallery’ - When image viewer/gallery is opened
‘none’ - Default value
Type
enum(‘alert’, ‘gallery’, ‘none’)
setOverlay
Setter for overlay. You can use this setter to show the overlay.

Type
(overlay) => void
style
A theme object to customize the styles of SDK components. Detailed information on theming can be found in the customization documentation.

Themes are inherited from parent providers. A theme provided to the OverlayProvider will be the base theme style is merged into. Themes are not hoisted though, therefore a theme provided to Chat will not change overlay components such as the attachment picker.

Chat
© Getstream.io, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Chat
Chat provides the ChatContext, TranslationContext, and ThemeContext to its child components. Chat is the second highest level component in the Stream Chat for React Native library with only the OverlayProvider at a higher level.

Chat is also responsible for tracking the health of the WebSocket connection with Stream Chat server. The value isOnline provided by the ChatContext indicates the status of the connection.

General Usage
Chat should be rendered inside of the OverlayProvider at a high level of your application, similar to the OverlayProvider.

We recommend using only one instance of Chat provider per application unless absolutely needed.


import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import {
  ChannelList,
  Chat,
  OverlayProvider,
  useCreateChatClient,
} from "stream-chat-react-native";
const chatApiKey = "REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY";
const chatUserId = "REPLACE_WITH_USER_ID";
const chatUserName = "REPLACE_WITH_USER_NAME";
const chatUserToken = "REPLACE_WITH_USER_TOKEN";
const user = {
  id: chatUserId,
  name: chatUserName,
};
export const App = () => {
  const chatClient = useCreateChatClient({
    apiKey: chatApiKey,
    userData: user,
    tokenOrProvider: chatUserToken,
  });
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={chatClient}>
        <ChannelList />
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};
You can use the useCreateChatClient hook from stream-chat-react-native/stream-chat-expo to create a client instance and automatically connect/disconnect a user as per the example above, for simplicity.

Context Providers
Chat contains providers for the ChatContext, ThemeContext, and TranslationContext. These can be accessed using the corresponding hooks.

Context	Hook
ChatContext	useChatContext
ThemeContext	useTheme
TranslationContext	useTranslationContext
Props
client
Instance of StreamChat client.

Type

closeConnectionOnBackground
When set to false the WebSocket connection won’t disconnect when sending the app to the background. To receive push notifications it’s necessary that user doesn’t have an active WebSocket connection. By default the WebSocket connection is disconnected when the app goes to the background, and reconnects when app comes to the foreground.

Type	Default

Channel
Channel
The Channel component is the main entry point for many Stream Chat customizations and contains the majority of the content providers and a significant amount of the logic utilized by Stream Chat for React Native. Components, custom and out of the box, channel information, and UI integrated chat functions are disseminated by the contexts contained in Channel. MessageList, MessageInput, and Thread all rely on Channel to function correctly.

Basic Usage
Channel takes an instance of a StreamChat channel as a prop. You can create a channel, or if you are navigating from the ChannelList, access the selected channel via the parameter passed to the onSelect function.


import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import {
  Channel,
  Chat,
  MessageInput,
  MessageList,
  OverlayProvider,
} from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => {
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState();
  useEffect(() => {
    const createAndWatchChannel = async () => {
      const newChannel = client.channel("messaging", "channel_id");
      await newChannel.watch();
      setChannel(newChannel);
    };
    createAndWatchChannel();
  }, []);
  return (
    <OverlayProvider>
      <Chat client={client}>
        <Channel channel={channel}>
          <MessageList />
          <MessageInput />
        </Channel>
      </Chat>
    </OverlayProvider>
  );
};

Channel contains providers for the ChannelContext, KeyboardContext, MessageInputContext, MessagesContext, PaginatedMessageListContext, AttachmentPickerContext, MessageComposerContext, ThreadContext, and TypingContext. These can be accessed using the corresponding hooks.

Context	Hook
ChannelContext	useChannelContext
KeyboardContext	useKeyboardContext
MessageInputContext	useMessageInputContext
MessagesContext	useMessagesContext
PaginatedMessageListContext	usePaginatedMessageListContext
AttachmentPickerContext	useAttachmentPickerContext
MessageComposerContext	useMessageComposerAPIContext
ThreadContext	useThreadContext
TypingContext	useTypingContext
UI Customizations
Channel is the entry point for customizing the majority of the Stream Chat for React Native SDK. The UI can be tailored to your design by replacing any number of components with custom components. Custom components provided as props to Channel will be utilized throughout the SDK where appropriate.

Customizing the message avatar can be done easily by providing a custom component to the appropriate prop.


import { Image } from "react-native";
import { Channel, useMessageContext } from "stream-chat-react-native";
const CustomAvatar = () => {
  const { message } = useMessageContext();
  return <Image source={{ uri: message.user?.image }} />;
};
<Channel MessageAvatar={CustomAvatar} />;

    <Channel
      onPressMessage={({ additionalInfo, defaultHandler, emitter }) => {
          if (emitter === 'textMention') {
            console.log(additionalInfo?.user);
            return;
          }
          if (emitter === 'card' || emitter === 'textLink') {

maximumMessageLimit
This component is available since version 8.6.2 of the SDK.

A prop that controls the number of messages that will be kept in memory at any given time.

It is particularly useful for usages of Channel and MessageList in situations where we have a really high traffic of messages (i.e a livestream) where it is inconvenient (and unnecessary) to keep every single message we’ve received in memory.

Technical caveats:

It will affect how the underlying MessageList works
Whenever going past the maximumMessageLimit, the oldest messages will be pruned (only in memory)
Messages will not be pruned if we have scrolled near the current top of the MessageList
Pagination will still work as normal for messages we’ve removed from memory

Type
function
Parameter	Description
payload	{ additionalInfo, actionHandlers, message }
The additionalInfo prop is handy for getting information from certain click events. A good example of this is getting the user details when a textMention (for example @Enigma-I-am) is clicked.

For example:


    <Channel
      onPressMessage={({ additionalInfo, defaultHandler, emitter }) => {
          if (emitter === 'textMention') {
            console.log(additionalInfo?.user);
            return;
          }
          if (emitter === 'card' || emitter === 'textLink') {
            console.log(additionalInfo?.url);
            return;
          }
          if (emitter === 'fileAttachment') {
            console.log(additionalInfo?.attachment);
            return;
          }

MessageInput
MessageInput
MessageInput component provides all the UI and necessary functionality (e.g, attachment picker, commands, mentions autocomplete etc.) for composing a message. This component must be used as child of Channel component.

General Usage

import { StreamChat } from "stream-chat";
import {
  Chat,
  Channel,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  OverlayProvider,
} from "stream-chat-react-native";
const client = StreamChat.getInstance("api_key");
export const App = () => (
  <OverlayProvider>
    <Chat client={client}>
      <Channel channel={channel}>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Channel>
    </Chat>
  </OverlayProvider>
);
TypeScript
File type
The File type is now exported from the stream-chat-react-native package and extends the FileReference type from the stream-chat package. It looks like this:


import { FileReference } from "stream-chat";
export type File = FileReference;
Props
All the configuration for MessageInput can be done on Channel component. Additionally please take a look at our Guide Section on how to customize MessageInput UI

boolean
members
Members of current channel. This value is received from backend when you query a channel, either using client.queryChannels() or channel.watch() API call.

client.queryChannels() or channel.watch() returns only up to 100 members of channel. So if you expect total number of members to be > 100, its better to use client.queryMembers() API endpoint separately to get the list of members.


Record<
  string, // userId
  {
    banned?: boolean;
    created_at?: string;
    invite_accepted_at?: string;
    invite_rejected_at?: string;

sendMessage
Sends a composed message within MessageInput component to channel. This function is attached to onPress handler of SendButton. The message optimistically gets added to message list UI first, before actually making API call to server. During this intermediate stage, MessageStatus component will display an indicator for “pending” state.

Type
Function
The function takes an object as a parameter with the following properties:

Parameter	Description
localMessage	Contains the message data that will be shown in the UI immediately
message	Contains the data that will be sent to the backend

showPollCreationDialog
A boolean signifying whether the poll creation dialog is shown or not. Will always be false if PollCreateContent is custom.

Type
boolean
threadList
Tells the Channel component if it is rendering a thread. We use this flag to avoid concurrency problems between a regular channel and a channel containing a thread.

Type
boolean
watchers
Watchers of current channel. This value is received from backend when you query a channel, either using client.queryChannels() or channel.watch() API call.

client.queryChannels() or channel.watch() returns only up to 100 watchers for channel. So if you expect total number of watchers to be > 100, you should request them explicitly using Channel Pagination
