## 🎯 **Recommended Pricing Tiers**

### **Option 1: Full Source Code **
**Price: $5,000 - $20,000 USD**

This includes:
- Complete source code (mobile + admin)
- Firebase project configuration
- Documentation
- 2 weeks of support/handover
---

## ⚠️ **Important Client Considerations**

1. **Stream.io Costs**: The app uses Stream.io which costs **$500-2000+/month** for chat + video. Clients need to factor this in.

2. **Firebase Costs**: Depending on usage, Firebase can cost **$50-500/month** for moderate traffic.

3. **App Store Fees**: $99/year (Apple) + $25 one-time (Google)

4. **Maintenance**: Apps need updates for new OS versions, library updates, etc.

---

## 📋 **My Final Recommendation**

Given that:
- This is a **production-ready** mental health app
- Currently in **Google Play closed testing**
- Has **comprehensive features** (chat, video, booking)
- Includes **admin panel**
- Uses **premium services** (Stream.io)
- ~**38,000 lines** of quality TypeScript code

### **Suggested Starting Price: ₹10-15 Lakhs ($12,000-18,000 USD)**

For Indian market specifically:
- **Minimum**: ₹5 Lakhs ($3500)
- **Fair Price**: ₹8 Lakhs (~$14,400)
- **Premium**: ₹15-18 Lakhs (~$18,000-21,600)

This accounts for the fact that building this from scratch would take a team 4-6 months and cost significantly more.
